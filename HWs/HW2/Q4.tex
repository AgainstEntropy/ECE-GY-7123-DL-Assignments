{Randomly drop 5 points into a 1 by 1 square region. Linking any three points, we get a triangle. Find the probability that there is at least one triangle with area less than or equal to 1/4.} \\
\myAnswer{
If we divided the square into two halves, then at least one half will contain 3 or more points, which can form at least one triangle. Since the area of the half square is 1/2, the triangle's area must be smaller or equals to 1/4. \\
Therefore, the probability that there is at least one triangle with area less than or equal to 1/4 is \underline{1}.
