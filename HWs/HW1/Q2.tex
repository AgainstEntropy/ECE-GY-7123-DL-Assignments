\textbf{(3 points)} \textit{Algebraic exercises with gradients}. Suppose that $z$ is a vector with $n$ elements. We would like to compute the gradient of $y = \textrm{softmax}(z)$. Show that the Jacobian of $y$ with respect to $z, J$, is given by the expression:
\[
    J_{ij} = \frac{\partial y_i}{\partial z_j} = y_i (\delta_{ij} - y_j),
\]
where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Dirac delta, i.e., 1 if $i = j$ and 0 else. \textit{Hint: Your algebra could be simplified if you try computing the log derivative, $\frac{\partial \log y_i}{\partial z_j}$.}
