\textbf{(3 points)} \textit{Improving the FashionMNIST classifier}. In the \href{https://github.com/kvgarimella/dl-demos/blob/main/demo01-basics.ipynb}{\underline{first demo}}, we trained a simple logistic regression model to classify MNIST digits. Repeat the same experiment, but now use a (dense) neural network with three (3) hidden layers with 256, 128, and 64 neurons respectively, all with ReLU activations. Display train- and test- loss curves, and report test accuracies of your final model. You may have to tweak the total number of training epochs to get reasonable accuracy. Finally, draw any 3 image samples from the test dataset, visualize the predicted class probabilities for each sample, and comment on what you can observe from these plots.
